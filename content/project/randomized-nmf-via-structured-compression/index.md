Random projections have been recently implemented in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to speed-up the NMF computations, with a negligible loss of performance. In this paper, we investigate the effects of such projections when the NMF technique uses the fast Nesterov gradient descent (NeNMF). We experimentally show that structured random projections significantly speed-up NeNMF for very large data matrices.
