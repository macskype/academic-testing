# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: In a recently published work, a novel algorithm has been presented for detecting edges via model fitting. This novel method is seen to work competitively alongside earlier known methods like the Prewitt and canny operators. An extended version of this algorithm is under investigation to aid in the correction/mitigation of the motion artifacts and examine its practical implementations in real life scenarios.

## Artifact Mitigation

Goal: In a recently published work, a novel algorithm has been presented for detecting edges via model fitting. This novel method is seen to work competitively alongside earlier known methods like the Prewitt and canny operators. An extended version of this algorithm is under investigation to aid in the correction/mitigation of the motion artifacts and examine its practical implementations in real life scenarios.
